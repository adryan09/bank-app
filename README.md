# Getting Started with Create React App
This is a playground of implementing a small app which offers the user the option create a page with a list of bank cards containg added by the user.Also some editing actions could be possible
This repo invited me to play with some validations and redux thunk as a middleware
To be noted it has a lots of bugs, which not even today are fixed.
Also, do not expect to see lazy loading or other peformance mecanism.

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`
